# Your Personalized Study Plan

Based on your progress and our available courses, here is a recommended study path to help you achieve your learning goals efficiently.

## 1. Complete "Next.js for Beginners"

You have made some progress here. We recommend finishing the remaining modules to build a solid foundation.
- **Module 2: Styling and Components**: Great work on this module!
- **Module 3: Data Fetching**: This is a crucial skill. Focus on understanding both static and server-side rendering.

## 2. Start "Advanced TypeScript"

After mastering Next.js basics, deepening your TypeScript knowledge is the next logical step. Your Next.js skills will be even more powerful with strong TypeScript knowledge.
- **Start with Module 1: Generics**: This will build a strong foundation for reusable and type-safe components.
- **Move to Module 2: Utility Types**: Learn how to manipulate types effectively.

## 3. Project: Build a Full-Stack App

Apply your skills by building a complete application. This will solidify your learning from both courses and prepare you for real-world projects.
